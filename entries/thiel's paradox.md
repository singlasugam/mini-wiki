# Thiel’s Paradox    In addition to a number of excellent stories, the author mentions Thiel’s Paradox from early Facebook investor -   > **When a reputable [[venture firm]] leads two consecutive rounds of investment in a company, Andreessen told me, Thiel believes that that is “a screaming buy signal, and the bigger the markup on the last round the more _undervalued_ the company is.**” Thiel’s point, which takes a moment to digest, is that, when a company grows extremely rapidly, even its bullish V.C.s, having recently set a relatively low value on the previous round, will be slightly stuck in the past. The faster the growth, the farther behind they’ll be. Andreessen grinned, appreciating the paradox: the more they paid for Mixpanel—according to Thiel, anyway—the better a deal they’d be getting.  Generally, [[entrepreneurs]] want to bring in new investors for each round of [[funding]] so that they can create an auction-like environment to get the best combination of valuation and value-add. Thiel’s Paradox is that for entrepreneurs of [[fast growing companies]], an insider round from existing investors, no matter the [[valuation]], results in a good deal for investors. The next time you read about a [[startup]] raising another round of funding exclusively from the existing investors, think about Thiel’s Paradox.  #thiel #VC #funding
